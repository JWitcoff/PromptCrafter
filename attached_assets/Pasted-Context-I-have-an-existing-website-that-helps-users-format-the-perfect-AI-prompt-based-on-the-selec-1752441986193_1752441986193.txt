Context:
I have an existing website that helps users format the perfect AI prompt based on the selected GPT model (GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5, etc.). Currently, users first select their desired model and then enter their task to receive an optimized prompt.
Objective:
Modify the existing flow so that users:
First, input their task or use case description (what they want the AI to do).
Then, receive a recommended GPT model based on their task.
Clearly indicate why this model is recommended (e.g., cost efficiency, speed, accuracy, complexity handling).
Allow the user to review other models and select an alternative if desired, accompanied by brief, helpful descriptions of each model.
Finally, after the model is selected (recommended or otherwise), generate and display the optimized prompt specific to their task and the selected model.
Implementation Requirements:
Add an initial input field for users to describe their tasks clearly.
Build a simple backend logic (rule-based is fine for now) to recommend models based on keywords, task complexity, response length needed, and sensitivity to accuracy vs. cost vs. speed.
Provide a clean, user-friendly interface that explicitly shows:
Recommended model with justification.
Option to override the recommendation, with concise summaries of other available models (strengths, weaknesses, use cases).
Retain existing functionality to generate and display the optimized prompt after the final model selection step.
Deliverables:
Update the current frontend components to reflect the new workflow:
Task description input → Model recommendation/selection → Prompt generation.
Backend logic (simple rule-based recommendation engine) clearly defined and easily extensible.
Example User Flow (to illustrate):
User inputs: "Summarize lengthy legal contracts clearly and concisely."
System recommends: GPT-4o, noting:
"Recommended for complex tasks that require nuanced understanding and high accuracy."
User reviews other models (optional):
GPT-3.5: Faster and cheaper, ideal for simpler, shorter tasks.
GPT-4-turbo: Balanced performance, suitable for moderately complex tasks with speed.
User confirms GPT-4o or selects an alternative → Site generates optimized prompt.
